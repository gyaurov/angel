    <p class="project">Another toilet queue was organized in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria on 20 March starting time 12:00. 
      81 citizens took part and joint to express their solidarity to people without access to sanitation. Our local accent was put on lack of access to toilets for people with physical disabilities and specific needs. 
      The queue was organized by NGO Earth Forever - national focal point of WSSCC, in collaboration with city library Stara Zagora, center for people with disabilities, high school &quot;Romain Rolland&quot;, Association &quot;Eyesight&quot;. 
      Media (incl. electronic media) expressed very high interest and the queue got national visibility.
    Attached are<a href="../pics/p17queuephotos.rar" target="_blank"> pictures</a> from our queque.</p>
    <p class="project">Every  day, 4,000 children are dying because they, alongside billions of others, have  no access to safe sanitation and clean water. World leaders <em>have</em> so far neglected this global crisis –  fatally undermining the fight against  poverty, ill health and indignity. But Spring 2010 provides a real opportunity  for change. It is up to campaigners across the world to grasp it. Late April will see ministers from countries across Africa,  Asia, Europe and North America  gather in Washington for the first ever High-Level Meeting on Sanitation and Water. The meeting aims to make steps forward in ensuring  access to these most basic  rights, yet real progress will require strong campaigning. To take advantage of this unique political opportunity, three  global networks representing hundreds of civil society organisations (End  Water Poverty, the Freshwater Action  Network and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council), have come together to launch a worldwide campaign to form The World’s  Longest Toilet Queue. With campaigners  like you organising World Record breaking Queues all over the world and using them to demand action from local, national and  international political leaders –  we can put sanitation and water at the top of the global agenda where it belongs. </p>

      <br>
      <strong>Join us and stand up in solidarity with</strong><strong> </strong><strong>the 2.5 billion people across the world</strong><strong> </strong><strong>who still have to wait in line for their</strong><strong> </strong><strong>right to use a safe and dignified toilet.</strong></p>
    <p class="project"><strong class="text8">How to join the Queue</strong><br />
      <span class="text10"><strong>The basics: </strong>Organising a simple queue is easy; all you need to do is organise a group of people, large or small, to queue up for a toilet for at least 10 minutes. The toilet can be real, fake or even someone dressed up as one!</span></p>
    <p class="project">As we want these queues to stand out and have real impact, feel  encouraged to make your Queue attention-grabbing, media-friendly and politically meaningful. Look on the next page and on<a href="http://www.worldtoiletqueue.org" target="_blank"> <strong>www.worldtoiletqueue.org</strong></a> for a host of examples to inspire you. To be counted as part of the Guinness World  Record attempt you need to hold your  queue between 20 - 22 March 2010. However,  if you cannot hold it during this period  &ndash; or it would be more effective at a different  time &ndash; please do still take action. We  will still count it and represent your voices  to ministers at the meeting. To be  part of the World Record attempt, there  are a few other simple conditions you  need to meet too &ndash; please check the guidelines  online.    </p>
