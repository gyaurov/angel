    <p class="project">The conference  was organized by Women for Water Partnership and hosted by WfWP member, Earth  Forever Foundation, a well established Bulgarian NGO, specialized in sanitation  and hygiene for schools, rural communities and peri-urban areas. The  conference was supported by WSSCC, Geneva. <br />
      <br />
      Safe  sanitation and clean drinking water are indispensable among the Millennium  Development Goals. Women for Water Partnership (WfWP) is a major player in this  field. Through our dynamic networking approach and working conferences, we  encourage and support women driven NGOs and CBOs to develop and successfully  implement sustainable bottom-up and gender sensitive projects to improve  sanitation, hygiene and drinking water in poor rural communities.</p>

    <p class="project"><img src="../pics/p18-3.jpg" width="680" height="510" alt=""/><br />
      <br />
      67  participating representatives of WfWP member organisations and guests came to  attend the conference from Romania, Armenia, Moldova, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan,  Turkey, France, The Netherlands and Bulgaria. A broad sample of sanitation and  water stakeholders from Bulgaria took part representing Bulgarian parliament, regional  agencies, local authorities, national parks, universities, schools, media,  business, NGOs, CBOs and youth. Representatives of the Joint Secretariat of  Water and Health protocol and Bulgarian Parliament joint.Participants got a  better feeling of Bulgarian reality and were introduced to successfully  implemented sustainable sanitation projects during the field trip. Parallel to  the conference official meetings were organised with high level Bulgarian  officials from government and state administration.<br />

      <span class="text5"><img src="../pics/p18_1.jpg" width="214" height="69" hspace="10" align="left" /></span>The Regional Working Conference concept has  turned out to be very successful. At the  WfWP working conferences initiatives of local NGOs, amongst others from WfWP member organisations, are  developed into concrete projects. Relevant stakeholders are invited to  participate in the joint development and subsequent implementation of these  projects. The knowledge and experience about a.o. partnerships, appropriate  technologies, micro finance, and upscaling of successful initiatives are  exchanged and put to practice.
