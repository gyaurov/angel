    <p class="protitle">Exchange Visit to NVB Suriname</p>
    
   <p><div class="projectfloat"><img src="../pics/p16.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"/>   </div></p>
    <p class="project">This exchange  visit was organized with the financial support of Women for Water Partnership;  in the context of member support mechanism</p>
    <p class="project"> Earth Forever experts visited The Republic of Suriname from August 9  through August 22, 2009 to share their experience on the construction, safe  operation and maintenance of Urine Diverting Toilet introduced by the  Netherland Women Organisation (NVB), Suriname. The visit was focused on several  maroon communities in the River Interior and two Amerindian communities in the  old coast area. It was capped with presentations to various ministries and  bodies in Paramaribo, the national capital.</p>
    <p class="project"> At the Interior we  observed, barring some minor defects, that the structures were of remarkable  compact design involving adequate masonry and carpentry. There is excellent  co-ordination work and supervision by the local co-ordinator, Captain Albert,  who is one of the traditional leaders of these communities. From all  indications, his success is facilitated and enhanced by his leadership-by-example  principle, since he has already one of those ECOSAN toilets in his household. Earth  Forever experts visited each of the ecosan structures and made recommendations  for improvement of the construction work. We also shared experience on safe  operation and maintenance, as well as safe treatment and re-use of treated  sanitation products.<br />

    <p class="text7"><br />
    With regard to the  Amerindian communities, the NVB, the initiators of the project, had at that  moment finalised plans to commence work in this area. Consequently, the Earth  Forever experts delivered presentations focused on the ECOSAN concept that  included the toilet structure, the health and hygiene characteristics and the  re-use of the waste products.</p>
    <p class="project"> We observed that  some few families were already operating the flush toilet system but this  situation did not seem to douse any possibility of increased enthusiasm for the  ECOSAN system. In fact we noticed many positive signs of ECOSAN acceptability  in this community. We made recommendations for improved methodology of  construction of ECOSAN structures. So, there and then, we recommended a training  of constructors to fit the imperatives of these requirements. </p>
    <p class="project"><img src="../pics/p16-2.jpg" width="680" height="510" alt=""/></p>
    <p class="project"> The other half of  our visit was devoted to making multimedia presentations to stakeholders at  various levels in Paramaribo. These presentations focused on the ECOSAN concept  and illustrative examples with Bulgaria as a case study. The presentations  included also the environmental, health and hygiene implications, maintenance  and re-use. Our audiences included the Ministry of Health (with the Minister  himself, the Permanent Secretary and key staff in attendance), the Ministry of  Environment (with the Permanent Secretary and other key staff in attendance),  the Public Health Department (with the Director of Public Health in  attendance); we had two training sessions for the Steering Committee members of  the NVB, its staff and donors, NGOs, NVB partners, and government personnel.</p>
    <p class="project"> Finally, we had a  working meeting with the ECOSAN Steering Committee, chaired by the NVB  chairperson. Furthermore, we participated in the legal issues that would form  the background for a national legislation on the ECOSAN concept.<br />
