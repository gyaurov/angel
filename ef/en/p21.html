    <p class="project">The project goal is to empower rural women and girls to apply a bottom-up approach to enforce EU wastewater treatment  legislation in their households and their communities, simultaneously raising health and food security for their  families. </p>
    <p class="project"> The project involves 100 jobless  and low-income women and girls from at least 3 rural communities in a series of  activities: awareness raising, vocational learning-by-doing training,  leadership training and coaching programs, as well as intensive online  communication, aiming at empowerment for equitable involvement of women in  decision-making, starting sanitation jobs and launching small-scale business in  alternative sanitation sector. Mentored by consultants, trainees will construct  a model alternative sanitation system for a community cultural center or a  school in one of the project communities.    </p>

    <p class="project"> Forever will Earthcoordinate the project activities, share alternative sanitation  expertise and develop training and promotional materials with the support of  experienced trainers and consultants. All efforts will be made to collaborate  with state and local government health, environment and water institutions,  labor authorities, water and sanitation utility provider, local and  international NGOs, media, as well as to involve all community stakeholders &ndash;  mayoralties, community centers, schools, cooperatives, civil society groups,  etc. to ensure community ownership of project results and sustainable usage and  maintenance.</p>
    <p class="project"> Project  results will be shared on broad scale nationally and internationally via  website, social media, webinar, presentations at national and international  events, press-conferences, etc.</p>
    <p class="project"> Local  SI Club &ndash; Plovdiv, will develop and implement the project monitoring and  evaluation program.</p>
    <p class="project">The project is motivated  by the need to mobilize women and girls from the rural communities  to build capacity and leadership skills to address adequately the immediate  water and sanitation issues in their households and communities.</p>
    <p class="project"> Water and  sanitation sector (WS) is destined to vigorous rate of development as Bulgaria  is striving to meet the requirements of EU Wastewater directive &ndash; 91/271/EEC. The  EU Environmental Implementation Review, Country Report &ndash; Bulgaria, 2017,  highlights that Bulgaria demonstrates, in general, very low compliance rates  with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. </p>
    <p class="project"> The enforcement of the Directive for smaller agglomerations &ndash; less than 10000  p.e., with compliance obligations since end 2014, has not practically begun.  Thus, Bulgaria is facing enormous penalties in the closest future following the  established mechanism. In July 2017, the government already received a warning  letter from the Commission.</p>
    <p class="project"> The EFF&rsquo;s concern is that the state has no capacity to enforce the Directive  applying the usual ridiculously unaffordable solutions of WCs, central sewerage  and conventional WWTPs. &nbsp;This approach is  especially harmful for the small rural communities with very limited financial  and human resources where the life of the people is dependent on very limited  water resources with vast seasonal variations. These communities are also most  vulnerable to climate change. For all these, the project will focus on affordable  alternatives meeting the EU regulations.</p>
    <p class="project"> Additionally, villages practically do not offer any jobs. That&rsquo;s why, we look  at the proposed project as a vocational training for a well-defined niche of  identified sanitation need, as well as specific skills of natural agriculture  that goes well with some aspects of sustainable sanitation as composting of  biological waste and utilization of treated wastewater for safe irrigation for  self-subsistent agriculture. The project will follow strictly the safety regulations  of World Health Organization for treatment and reuse and EU regulations.</p>
    <p class="project"> The project  goal is the empowering of rural women and girls to apply a bottom-up approach  and to enforce Directive 91/271/EEC on wastewater treatment in their households  and communities, and to raise health and food security for their families  applying safe alternative sanitation and reuse solutions.</p>

      <li class="project">Combining the       implementation of SDGs 3, 4, 5 and 6 with a focus on increasing access to       safe water and sanitation, better hygiene and health and more nutritious       food for women and girls.</li>
    
    
      <li class="project">Improving the poition of women and girls as  actors, experts and leaders through capacity development, vocational training  and leadership training and coaching as part and parcel of project design and  implementation. </li>
    
      <li class="project">Increasing public       awareness about the role of women and girls as leading partners in the       water and sanitation sector at every level to have water, sanitation, hygiene       and food security for all.  </li>
